# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Composer Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the PHP SDK project with Composer, PSR-4 autoloading, and directory structure following best practices.
# Details:
Create a new repository. Initialize with `composer init` and set up PSR-4 autoloading in composer.json. Structure directories as `src/`, `tests/`, `examples/`. Use PHP 8.1+ as minimum requirement. Add .gitignore for vendor and IDE files. Recommended: Composer 2.x, PHP 8.1+.

# Test Strategy:
Validate project structure, autoloading, and PHP version compatibility. Run `composer validate` and check autoloading with a simple test class. Since XGATE API has no sandbox environment, focus on unit tests for class instantiation and structure validation.
