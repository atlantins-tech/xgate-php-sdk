		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Composer Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup into subtasks such as initializing the repository, configuring composer with PSR-4 autoloading, and setting up directory structure and .gitignore files.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard project initialization steps with well-documented best practices and tools (Composer, PSR-4). It is straightforward but requires attention to detail to ensure proper structure and compatibility with PHP 8.1+.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Manager",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for environment variable loading, secure credential storage, multi-environment support, and PHPDoc documentation with usage examples.",
			"reasoning": "Managing configuration securely with environment variables and supporting multiple environments adds moderate complexity. The requirement for comprehensive PHPDoc and secure handling of credentials increases the task scope.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build HTTP Client Wrapper with Guzzle",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks including setting up Guzzle client, default headers configuration, implementing logging with Monolog, error and exception handling, and PHPDoc documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Wrapping Guzzle with logging, error handling, and detailed PHPDoc requires careful design to ensure robustness and maintainability. Testing with mocks adds to complexity.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Token Authentication Manager",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for login method implementation, token storage using PSR-16 cache, token retrieval and header injection, error handling with exceptions, and defining an authentication interface with PHPDoc.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to integration with HTTP client, secure token management, caching, error handling, and comprehensive documentation. The existing subtasks reflect a well-decomposed approach.[2]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Core XGateClient Class",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for dependency injection setup, implementing core methods for SDK operations, error handling integration, and PHPDoc documentation with usage examples.",
			"reasoning": "Orchestrating multiple components with dependency injection and providing a clean API requires careful design and documentation, but complexity is moderate given dependencies are already implemented.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Customer Resource and Model",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Customer model implementation with validation, CustomerResource API methods (create, get), and PHPDoc documentation with examples.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing resource and model with validation and API interaction is moderately complex, especially with data validation and serialization requirements.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Pix Resource and Key Model",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for PixKey model creation, PixResource API methods (create, list), and validation of key types with PHPDoc documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to Customer resource, this involves API interaction, validation of multiple key types, and model implementation with documentation, making it moderately complex.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Fiat Deposit and Withdrawal Resources",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for DepositResource implementation, WithdrawResource implementation, Transaction model with validation, and PHPDoc documentation with examples.",
			"reasoning": "Handling multiple resources with currency listing, transaction creation, validation, and error handling increases complexity beyond basic resource implementation.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Exception Handling and Error Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for defining custom exception classes, integrating exceptions with HTTP client and resources, implementing error message handling, and PHPDoc documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a robust exception hierarchy and integrating it consistently across the SDK requires careful design and comprehensive testing, adding moderate complexity.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Write Basic Documentation and Examples",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for writing installation guide, creating usage example scripts, and adding comprehensive PHPDoc annotations across the SDK.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation and examples are essential but less technically complex; however, ensuring clarity and completeness for IDE support requires attention to detail.[1]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Documentation Standards and PHPDoc Tools",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for configuring PHPStan with docblock validation, setting up PHP CS Fixer rules for documentation, creating standardized docblock templates, configuring IDE helpers, and documenting standards with pre-commit hooks.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up comprehensive tooling and standards for documentation validation and IDE support involves multiple tools and configurations, requiring advanced knowledge and careful integration.[1]"
